With the rise of COVID-19, an automated attendance tracker needs to be more
simple than it's ever been. The time-cost of checking into a digital classroom alone can
be hit-or-miss, depending on the students and teacher's internet speed. With that in
mind, the goal of this team is to provide an easy-to-use, reliable way of knowing who
was present for a class period. In order to minimize disruption, this system should
require little attention from students and faculty.

We believe a good way of handling this is through a two-part system. The
solution in mind would not require a teacher to have to call out, by name, each student
(a task which has been seen firsthand to take five or so minutes, at times). Requiring
that the student be present for that initial roll call results in students who are five or so
minutes late [for whatever reason] to have to meet with the teacher afterward, or disrupt
the class. That system is not respectful to anyone's schedule.

The issue that comes with allowing a student to simply clock in and say they
were present is that, no matter the method (Physical ID or User ID), the user could pass
their ID along to a costudent, for a given class, creating a false account of student
presence. Furthermore, without verification by the faculty that a student was present,
the student can possibly login digitally to a class and then disappear (removing actual
attendance). Our solution to this is a hybrid between these two systems.

When a student arrives in class (either physically or digitally), they must indicate
they are here by logging into a website we'll develop, if they're attending physically. If
attending digitally, we will develop a way (likely an extension) to look at Google Meet,
Blackboard, or Zoom, and automatically record a student's attendance by their logging
into the lecture. This act of "clocking in" would then provide a notification to the teacher
or lab assistant present for the class, who can then confirm the student presence with
the press of a button. This off-loading of work on the teacher's end provides a more
even spread of the workload required to maintain records of attendance. Addressing student attendance will provide a more accurate collection of data, regarding how often
a student was on time for class, as well as allow for quicker dismissal from the
classroom.
